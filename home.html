    <h1>Redesign Website</h1>

		<h2 class="context">Context</h2>
		<p>
			During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project: pick a website that
			was accessible to the public but could be redesigned to decrease usability. 
		</p>

		<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<img src="Infographic.jpg" class="graphic" alt="Infographic of the problems in the original" />
		<p>
			This website blurs the line between the images placed and the actual buttons 
		</p>

		<h2>Designs</h2>
		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Wendy</h4>
		<div class="imagebox">
			<div class="image" style="display: inline-block">
				<img src="Personas1.jpg" class="image2" alt="Empathy map of Working Wendy" />
			</div>
			<div class="text" style="display: inline-block; word-wrap: break-word">
				<p>
					The user is a mother of 4 children who uses the washing machine on a regular basis. They are used to the options
					and therefore rarely get frustrated; they know the exact button to use for each type of clothes and which to avoid
					entirely.<br />
					<br />

					This mother admitted that although she knows which options to choose for certain clothes, there are just way too
					many and most remain unused. In fact, she states that even she doesnâ€™t know what most of the functions do and will
					stick to the options that are understood easier. <br />
					<br />
					This mother represents the users that are familiar to the machine and its options yet still confused about the
					excessive options and their functions. However, these users still accept that they will never understand and
					proceed to do their daily jobs.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Bewildered Brian</h4>
		<div class="imagebox2">
			<div class="image" style="display: inline-block">
				<img src="Personas2.jpg" class="image3" alt="Empathy map of Bewildered Brian" />
			</div>
			<div class="text" style="display: inline-block; word-wrap: break-word">
				<p>
					This user is a new college grad coming back from school. The user is not new to the washing machine but is rather
					unfamiliar with all of its components and the model itself. They are unsure of each button pressed and the
					consequences/outcomes of each option.<br />
					<br />
					the user is a fairly new user puzzled by the machine and its options. He is unsure about almost all his decisions
					and questions if he has inputted the correct options for his wash. In the end, he gets increasingly frustrated with
					his confusion which pushes him to give up.
					<br />
					<br />
					This user represents the users unfamiliar with the functions of the machine and its choices. As a result, the users
					will typically walk away in frustration or start the machine to end the confusion.

		<h2>Takeaways</h2>
		<p class="ending">
			From this project, I have learned that over-complicating interfaces with every option can confuse users and distract
			them from their initial task. Interfaces should be a streamlined design that helps the user quickly access information
			without confusion from a quick scan. Additionally, I have learned how to effectively collect data and turn it into
			useful information about the users and their interactions with interfaces.
