	<h1>Redesign Website</h1>

	<h2 class="context">Context</h2>
	<p>
		During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project: pick a website that
		was accessible to the public but could be redesigned to decrease usability.
	</p>

	<h2>Research:</h2>
	<!-- <img src="Infographic.jpg" class="graphic" alt="Infographic of the problems in the original" /> -->

	<h4>Useability</h4>
	<p>
		The website does not have a cohesive layout; the important information is scattered throughout the page in
		random dividers varying in size. The nav bar is also confusing because it's not in a traditional places usually
		seen in websites. Additionally,the footer is missing the "menu" link and doesn't have all the components in the
		nav bar. The photos are unappealing and scattered, the font is too small and has some inconsistent spacing so
		its hard to read making the site even more harder to use. Overall, it feels dated and the layout of the buttons
		and the pictures makes the website hard to use and navigate.
	</p>

	<h4>Learnability</h4>
	<p>
		This website is incredibly hard to learn. The small buttons in the lower right hand corners
		all lead to the menu; however, it's really hard to even see at first glance. Plus. the hit boxes are only set to
		be the small buttons so the user has to learn that they can't just click the picture itself. These small
		inconsistent details make the website confusing and unappealing.
	</p>

	<h4>Memorability</h4>
	<p>
		Overall, this page is very forgettable. There is nothing either interface-wise or even
		graphic-wise that stands out or makes the user want to come back to the site more than once. In fact, the
		website might actually make the cafe more unappealing and unappetizing due to the crude pictures and the
		disregard for the appearance. This can potentially hurt business sales due to the first impressions and make the
		restaurant feel as if they don't care.
	</p>

	<h2>Accessibility</h2>
	<p>
		Using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAIM WAVE</a>, a website that reads a website and
		tells the programer any accessibility concerns, the program detected multiple errors both in the code and
		structural issues. For instance, there is 8 redundant links to the menu, no alternative text for users that see
		the pictures on their computer, and text that was barely visible due to poor contrast between the two colors.
		Additionally, there were many instances of large text blocks and the page itself has no structure at all.
		Because of these factors, I believe that the website could be redesigned to better optimize the structure and
		information on the page to help user accessibility.
	</p>


	<h2>Designs</h2>
	<h3>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h3>
	<div class="lofi" style="display: inline-block">
		<img src="Personas1.jpg" class="image2" alt="Empathy map of Working Wendy" />
	</div>
	<p>
		These three pictures depict the three types of low-fi wireframes that I had planned for the website. All three
		show the major types dimensions of screens today: laptop, tablet, and phone dimensions. Furthermore, I tried to
		address the main issues with the original site: contrast, layout, readability, and accessability for each link.
	</p>

	<h3>High-fidelity Prototype</h3>
	<div class="image" style="display: inline-block">
		<img src="Personas1.jpg" class="image2" alt="Empathy map of Working Wendy" />
	</div>
	<p>
		Using my lo-fi sketches, I translated it into HTML and CSS to create a new, more refined website for the cafe.

		The link to the final website can be found <a href="redesign.html" target="_blank">here</a>
